Do a demo on merging

1. create a repo on git

2. Select HTTPS not SSH, follow the instructions of creating a NEW repository, first create an empty folder
echo "# git_tutorial" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/kevin-w-li/git_tutorial.git
git push -u origin master

3. Ask each of them to create a git repo like this, add an file with some lines in it. Commit and pull

4. Ask them to add you into the repo for push

5. You go in and modify the files, commit and push

6. Students pull, edit the file again, commit and push

7. At the same time, create some conflict and commit, try push without pull

8. Pull, now show how to resolve a conflict by editing the file. Mention that there are better merge tools, or show your git mergetool

:diffg RE     # get from REMOTE
:diffg BA     # get from BASE
:diffg LO     # get from LOCAL
:diffupdate  #  remove leftover spacing issues
Ctrl w + h   # move to the split on the left 
Ctrl w + j    # move to the split below
Ctrl w + k   # move to the split on top
Ctrl w + l	    # move to the split on the right
]c - Jump to the next change.
[c - Jump to the previous change.


9. Commit and push the merge. Students pull.

10. Now you change the files again and push, ask the students to make conflicting changes, let them try merge.
