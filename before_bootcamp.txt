For students:
- install anaconda for Python 2.7. Make sure Jupyter notebooks work.
- install Pycharm
- For those who use Windows, make sure that they install Cygwin (Linux
  emulator). We will need this when talking about Slurm. Better if they can
install Virtualbox (virtual machine) and install Ubuntu there. 
- Windows users: putty (for ssh)


For us:
- Prepare an account for each student to login to Gatsby to test Slurm?
